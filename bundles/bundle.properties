unit.饱和火力-坝煞.details = [#ebf2a2]溢裂数据库已解码：\n[]一座人造岛屿，战斗要塞规模的大小为它提供了强大的武器搭载能力。防卫性武器配置高标准且全面：包括但不限于加农炮、脉冲枪、单点防御塔、鱼雷发射器······\n进攻性武器配置针对性及其明显——反重型装甲设施的透彻型弹药。显然是事出突然而无法及时切换能够进行高度落差打击的主武器配置。\n“真是万幸”

unit.饱和火力-神渎.description = 行动代号：“火天”-对我方阔野基地发起攻击的巨型机甲单位。\n[red]需要识别码以解锁溢裂要塞的实验数据库来解析更多信息······
unit.饱和火力-神渎.details = 外形神似泰坦，似乎是沿用了泰坦的部分设计，但武器配置截然不同。十分不理解它是如何在此等高温条件下安全储存携带如此多高能燃料······近乎饱和的纳米储存规模，足以支撑其作战直至彻底摧毁一整个区块的敌人。我们需要回收残骸以研究其内部构造
unit.饱和火力-地魁.name = Jupiter
unit.饱和火力-地魁.description = 行动代号：“绿化”-对我方生物实验基地发起强攻的巨型坦克型目标。\n[red]需要识别码以解锁溢裂要塞的实验数据库来解析更多信息······
unit.饱和火力-地魁.details = [#ebf2a2]溢裂数据库已解码：\n[]双联装末敏爆破主炮，两门攻城火炮，内爆防空导弹······几乎面面俱到的武器配置，巨大的本体使其碾压能力无可比拟，从陆上接近实在不是一个明智之举。\n轻型空中单位无法承受他的防空火力，重型空中单位也没有足够的时间接近并造成有效的伤害。\n一个非常棘手的敌人······
unit.饱和火力-西木.name = Saturn
unit.饱和火力-西木.description = 行动代号：“破天”-针对性剿灭行动的目标之一。\n[red]需要识别码以解锁溢裂要塞的实验数据库来解析更多信息······
unit.饱和火力-西木.details = [#ebf2a2]溢裂数据库已解码：\n[]战略级轨道轰炸机，技术成熟（艹，是个坏消息）。搭载一门峰压射线和冷脉冲炮。能够多次反复进出战场，携带各种炸药、单位对目标进行毁灭性打击。


unit.饱和火力-电鳄.name = Electrodile
unit.饱和火力-电鳄.description = A swifty hover artillery platform. Equiped with a tri-barreled electroartillery.
unit.饱和火力-电鳄.details = 实验性重型悬浮载具，从其内置系统与能量分配推测由雷鸣系列发展而来。\n从中央数据库获取其蓝图后，逆向工程的难度大幅降低并迅速复原了机型。后续的改进型号中增设短程推进系统，用于翻越中小型复杂地形。

unit.饱和火力-沧海A.name = 沧海
unit.饱和火力-沧海A.description = 标准化水面战斗舰艇。
unit.饱和火力-沧海A.details = [#a3ba73]溢裂数据库已解码：\n[]代号“沧海”\n全波段雷达隐身，海面作战主力舰种。我们的海面防御大多数都被其武器系统压制，其导弹配置被加密，其余由型号编号推测为升级优化的另一批制式装备。\n千倍警惕，万分小心！尤其是它的导弹系统，能量与实弹的混合打击方案能轻易过载绝大多数拦截体系，倘若时运不佳再承受一次其他方向的饱和打击······那绝对不是一个好事情
unit.饱和火力-沧海B.name = 洪波
unit.饱和火力-沧海B.description = 标准化两栖攻击舰，搭载多种单位登陆作战。
unit.饱和火力-沧海B.details = [#a3ba73]溢裂数据库已解码：\n[]代号“洪波”\n全波段雷达隐身，大型登陆舰。船舱容量极大，能够容纳多数单位并且搭载更多弹药，通常会跟随登陆部队行动并承担特殊火力或修复等事项。\n“外侧为莱普硬化装甲······这东西是怎么上岸的？或者说，这鬼玩意是怎么浮起来的？？？”
#unit.饱和火力-沧海C.name = 碣石
#unit.饱和火力-沧海C.description = 重型舰只，搭载一台大型护盾投影仪以及数个裂解光束。\n进入固定防守姿态后展开剩余火力系统。
#unit.饱和火力-沧海C.details = [#a3ba73]溢裂数据库已解码：\n[]代号“碣石”\n重型多功能集成巡洋舰，功能更加全面且强悍：防空反舰、实弹拦截、维修援助······\n似乎采用新型装甲结构，常规武器（尤其是能量武器）对作用微乎其微。\n所幸[darkerGray]该种型号的[]舰只并没有形成多少战斗力，推测投入实战时间并不久且动力系统尚不完善。
#unit.饱和火力-沧海D.name = 刃海
#unit.饱和火力-沧海D.description = 标准化水面主力舰艇。
#unit.饱和火力-沧海D.details = [#a3ba73]溢裂数据库已解 ：\n[]代号“刃海”\n刃海级导弹巡洋舰，全波段雷达隐身，武库级导弹配置\n搭载几乎所有已知和未知（有待考证）种类的导弹，只搭载了少部分近防炮与常规舰炮。\n与之作战显然不是一个好主意，一旦遭遇则最先抵达雷达范围内的应会是各种型号的导弹，不奢求舰队对其有多少反击能力，应当立刻报告坐标并警告周围部队远离此处。
